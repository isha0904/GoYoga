Domain: Gesture-Based Interactive Displays

What problems do we aim to tackle? 

1. Our gesture-based pose recognition tool will be  designed for individuals who can't access fitness centers easily, such as the elderly.
2. Provide the accuracy that results in better posture and effectiveness of the workouts provided.
3. Adjusting workouts to fit individual fitness levels, which is crucial for safe and effective stamina building. 
4. Encourage regular workouts to keep up with your fitness journey!


WE USE GESTURE RECOGNITION: 
> Unlike other apps that merely demonstrate poses, our tool would ensure accuracy in execution by recognising the body postures through gesture recognition and give an accuracy score.

> Using cameras, it provides real-time feedback on users' form, the pose detection model giving the feedback for each pose.

> The pose detection model is trained on various images of the each suryanamaskar pose that show the ideal posture.

> This personalized feedback helps users improve their technique.

WE MAKE IT INTERACTIVE AND EASY TO USE:
> The whole interface can be controlled via gestures, making it hands-free, elevating the user experience.
> The interactive interface encourages the user to workout regularly.
